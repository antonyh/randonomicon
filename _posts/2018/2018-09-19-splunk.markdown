Splunk
======

Splunk is an awesome product that has a terrible, terrible name. It's a
log indexer on steroids, which is such a dreadful clich√©. It's great
power comes from ingesting (another terrible word) all the log data you
can feed it, and a powerful, flexible, bot somehow easy and logical
query language that makes it straightforward to find nuggets of useful,
actionable information.

Basic query format

search filter \| command \| more commands

You get one filter / search section, then a series of commands to sort,
filter, aggregate, or otherwise process the output. These are chained
left-to-right.

Searching is keyword field=keyword (it's really more of a contains than
exact equals) field not keyword (again, more like 'does not contain'
field in (A,B,C)

and a few variations. It's quite simple.

Commands This is where it gets interesting.

sort stats dc(field) top X field top X field, field top field by field

uniq(field)
