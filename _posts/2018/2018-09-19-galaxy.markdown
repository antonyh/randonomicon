Ansible Galaxy
==============

Ansible Galaxy is a collection of shared 'content' for Ansible. It
contains roles that you can use. As the quality of the roles in Ansible
Galaxy is highly likely to vary, it's mentioned here for completeness
and won't be mentioned again.

With that in mind, I would encourage exploring Galaxy for modules that
cover common applications, and to submit and share work that might help
others.
