Cucumber - Features and feature files
==========================

A feature file is a definition, a specification of sorts, that states
clearly a number of scenarios that must be tested. It's written in a
lingo known as humourously as 'Gherkin'.

The basic format of a Gherkin feature file

    Feature: this is a feature

      Scenario: this is a scenario
        Given X
        And Y
        When A
        And B
        Then Z


      Scenario Outline: This is another scenario
        Given X
        And Y
        When something is <word>
        Then check for <number>
        
        Examples:
        | word | number |
        | ant  | 1      |
        | bug  | 3      |
        | car  | 5      |
        
        

A lot has been writted about Gherkin and Cucumber tests, and there's
little reason to recite it all here. What doesn't seem to be covered is
a few golden rules that make the features make more sense and keep them
sane.

-   only Capitalise Given / When / Then - it makes it more readable

-   give useful names to the scenarios, as this appears in a lot of
    places

-   use proper names that fit the business requirements in the feature
    definitions as it makes it must easier to review the features

-   avoid words like click, open, touch, enter, and so on. these things
    below hidden away in the step definitions that exercise the feture

Given
-----

Given sets up the known state for the start of the test

When
----

When describes the action or actions you must take for the start to get
to the point you need to be to make an assertion

Then
----

Then is a test, a check, an assertion.
