Maximalism
==========

#### The Swiss-Army-Knife approach

Maximalism is an attempt to cover all bases, trap all exceptions,
validate all inputs, check all values, test all possible execution
branches, and foresee all possible futures for the codebase. It revolves
heavily around 'what if' scenarios, and is the anti-thesis of Lean
development.

The irony of the length of this article compared to the 'minimalism' article 
is not lost on the author.
