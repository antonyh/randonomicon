Run Jetty using Maven
=====================

Some projects can be run using Jetty using the jetty:run mojo or with
jetty:run-war. You'll probably need to set MAVEN\_OPTS to give enough
heap space for the server, and with Java 7 or earlier you might also
need to set MaxPermSize to a suitable value.

    MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m" 
    mvn jetty:run-war 

Run Tomcat using Maven
======================

The 'Cargo' plugin allows Maven to create a running Tomcat instance with
the application-under-development for convenience during development and
testing. I wouldn't imagine that this is a great way of productionising
your code, so please limit this to uses where it makes sense to have the
source code available.

You can find more about this here

-   <http://cargo.codehaus.org/Maven2+plugin>

-   <http://cargo.codehaus.org/Static+deployment+of+expanded+WAR>

This is the plugin declaration you will need to make this work.

    <plugin>
        <groupId>org.codehaus.cargo</groupId>
        <artifactId>cargo-maven2-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.4.8</version>
            <configuration>
                <container>
                    <containerId>tomcat8x</containerId>
                    <home>${env.CATALINA_HOME}</home>
                </container>
                <configuration>
                    <type>existing</type>
                    <home>${env.CATALINA_HOME}</home>
                </configuration>
                <deployables>
                    <deployable>
                        <groupId>com.yourcompany</groupId>
                        <artifactId>ROOT</artifactId>
                        <type>war</type>
                    <properties>
                        <context>${project.build.finalName}</context>
                    </properties>
                </deployable>
            </deployables>
            <deployer>
                <type>installed</type>
            </deployer>
        </configuration>
    </plugin>

Finally, to make it start Tomcat:

    mvn cargo:run

If you don't want to modify the POM, you can take the dirty shortcut and
use the plugin directly from the command line at the expense of lack of
control of the plugin settings:

    mvn clean verify org.codehaus.cargo:cargo-maven2-plugin:run

Cargo also offers the facility to use alternatives to Tomcat, namely
Glassfish, Jetty, JBoss, and so on.
