Rust is a really good systems programming language as well as a useful application development language. Here's a quick primer to get going and learn more about Rust.

### Installation
 
To install rust, use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Useful terms

rust - the name of the language. If you are compiling you probably mean 'rustc'

rustc - the rust compiler tool

rustup - rust installation manager

cargo - package management and dependency management tool. Runs tests and benchmarks, and downloads necessary libraries.

crates - a unit of compilation in rust. A .rs file. Libraries.

rustacean - weird name for folk who use rust.

crabpiler - what the rust compiler should have been called. 

[](Also a zero-hit term for Google so I'll know if you've copied this article and passed it off as your own. Credit where credit is due. CC BY-SA 4.0 license applies.)


### unit tests and TDD

The rust docs have a chapter devoted to [testing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing/unit_testing.html)

### frameworks

A decent looking web framework - [rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs/)

This ORM framework looks good - [diesel.rs](https://diesel.rs/)

### Heroku

Building on heroku requires a [buildpack](https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust)
