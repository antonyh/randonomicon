From Dr. Jay Young, consultant from Silver Spring, Maryland, I received
the initial push to even consider writing this book. Jay was a constant
"peer reader" and very welcome advisor durying this year-long process.

To all these wonderful people I owe a deep sense of gratitude especially
now that this project has been completed.

The era of modern began in 1958 with the invention of the integrated
circuit by J. S. Kilby of Texas Instruments [@kilby]. His first chip is
shown in Fig. I. For comparison, Fig. I.2 shows a modern microprocessor
chip, [@beren].

maximum line current density.

#### Side by Side Tables and Figures

\sidebyside{

the page. It is the initial caption of two side-by-side captions.}
}
{
Space for second figure...
\caption{This caption will go on the right side of
the page. It is the second of two side-by-side captions.}
}
The command `\sidebyside{}{}` works similarly for tables:

\sidebyside{
\caption{Table Caption} 
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
one&two&three&four\\

\end{tabular}
}
 {
\caption{Table Caption}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
A&B&C&D\\
a &second little& sample&table
\end{tabular}
}
When using `\sidebyside`, one must use the cross referencing command
`\label{}` after and *outside* of `\caption{}`:

     \begin{table} 
     \sidebyside{\caption{Table Caption}\label{tab1}
     first table}
     {\caption{Table Caption}\label{tab2} second table}
     \end{table}

or,

     \begin{figure} 
     \sidebyside{\vskip<dimen>\caption{fig caption}\label{fig1}}
     {\vskip<dimen>\caption{fig caption}\label{fig2}}
     \end{figure}
