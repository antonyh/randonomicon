Anatomy of the pom.xml file
===========================

The pom.xml is the Project Object Model, a declarative XML document that
describes the build and it's dependencies.

There's little need to reproduce the information published in the Maven
POM reference <https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Introduction>

Instead, have this diagram instead showing the top level elements in the
POM.

\centering
Most of this is optional or only applies under certain circumstances,
and Maven gives clear messages when something has been left out. It also
gives warnings if something isn't needed or conflicts with parent POM
declarations, so pay attention to the output from your build processes.
