Playbook
========

What is a playbook, and what does a playbook look like? In terms of
format, it's just YAML with a few settings and the roles required for
the target hosts.

In short, the playbook is what to do, the inventory is where to do it.
As a practical example, this playbook to install a WordPress server
(from
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples/blob/master/wordpress-nginx/site.yml>)
illustrates how a set of roles is applied to a set of hosts.

    ---
    - name: Install WordPress, MySQL, Nginx, and PHP-FPM
      hosts: wordpress-server
      remote_user: root
      # remote_user: user
      # sudo: yes
      
      roles:
        - common
        - mysql
        - nginx
        - php-fpm
        - wordpress

As we can see, it defines a display name for the playbook, the hosts it
will be applied to, the remote user to use, and a toggle to control use
of sudo.

It could run as root if you permit SSH connections as root (hint: you
should never allow this), or as a regular user account with sudo rights.

Finally, the playbook defines roles for the server. These are the roles
that this set of hosts needs. In this example, the common role is
applied, along with mysql for the database, nginx for a web server,
php-fpm for scripting, and the wordpress application.

Each role is distinct and atomic - it should be possible if the roles
are designed properly to install the mysql database elsewhere on it's
own server for example.
