What is Roots?

Roots is a static site compiler, that generates static html, css, and
javascript files. It's very good at helping to build static front-ends.
It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly
variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a
truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to
medium sized front-ends of any kind.
