What is this 'book'?
------------------

This book was originally a great big bundle of my rough notes and research
into various tools and platforms, tied together in a nice wrapper using
[LaTeX]{acronym-label="LaTeX" acronym-form="singular+short"} as a
typesetting tool. I started writing this up late in 2014, and realised
that formatting as a printed book is straightforward with the tools at
hand will help me focus and write things that might make sense later,
and maybe useful to others.

I then abandoned this in favour of just publishing the snippets online
as a website. I felt it would be wasteful to start from scratch so I 
imported all the content from the book (in any state of editing) and rolled
from there. There's a lot of guff.

This book is also a general indicator as to the development tools and
languages I think are interesting to me; all of this is real and used by
me right now. Nothing is research just for the sake of this book. It's
all stuff I've been working on and using, and not a wish-list of things
to do. The other general indicator of my interests is the huge pile of
unread books sat next to me, some of which may get mentioned.

### Who is this book for?

You are the best judge of your ability, if you want to dive in then 
I honestly hope this book helps you.

This book sometimes covers basics but only when it helps ground my
thoughts as I write or if I think it makes sense. There are a bazillion
books that introduce technologies, and instead of reproducing them I
might just add enough to get things rolling. Or I might just link to
them so you can go buy them. If it's a new technology or paradigm I'll
explore simpler things, but probably not if it's something like Java.
Either way, there are better uses of our time than yet another Hello
World tutorial so that's definitely something that's not likely to
appear here. When we are skimming over topics, code fragments will be
used instead of full listings. I'll assume that you know what to do with
them.

### About the book itself

This book has been created in LaTeX. The primary edit tool for this book
was <https://www.sharelatex.com>, an online collaborative editing tool.
It has been typeset as a book, single-sided for easier screen reading. 

Since then, it's evolved into a Jekyll and Markdown based website.

This book has an evil twin known as 'RoughNotes' that will never, ever,
ever see the light of day. When a chapter in there grows enough and is
cleaned up, it is moved into this book.

The other sources of information in this book are my Instapaper
collection, my DEVONThink clippings, and my browser bookmarks. It's a
goldmine waiting to be turning into something legible. There's also a
lot of notes in a product called 'Circus Ponies Notebook' that is sadly
Mac-only, and I need to liberate them into this book.

The glossary is in part inspired by Ambrose Bierce's Devils Dictionary,
published in 1906. This book of 'DevNotes' lacks both the depth of
cynicism and the wit of the Devils Dictionary, but is considerably more
advantageous to those seeking to program computers. To find out more,

This book may contain Amazon affiliate links that support the
development of new chapters. Click a link, buy a book, it's like voting
for new words.

Quick disclaimer: Whatever you do with your computer is your own fault.
If you type 'vagrant destroy' and it rubs out your only copy of your
working mission critical code project just before you commit it to SCM
then that's your doing and your really need to think hard about your
general working practises. If you are trying something out and it
doesn't work and you miss your deadline, this is also purely down to
you.


How complete is this book?
--------------------------

This 'book' is now a website. It'll probably never be truly finished, 
for many reasons:

-   technology changes quickly - there will always be something to add,
    amend, or improve

-   there is no real peer review of this material aside from the
    feedback from readers, so there's always going to be corrections
    needed. Feedback is welcome from the readers and helps refine the
    text

-   as a general rule I'm just adding when and where I feel like, based
    on things I'm actively using. This greatly depends on what I'm
    working on and how much time I have.

-   there's a lot of material that is not yet ready to include because
    it's either wrong or inaccurate, outdated, contains mistakes, or has
    not yet been formatted.

-   some areas dive deeper into the technology than others and it takes
    time to level this off so the book as a whole makes sense and is
    useful. The focus is on adding needed depth rather than taking away
    but without duplicating other resources

The chapter on Docker is mostly complete although rapidly becoming
outdated as Docker is constantly changing. Docker 1.5 was covered, it's
now up to 1.8.2 (as of last update). Mostly, it still appears to be useful 
information. 

Finally, the chapter on Magnolia CMS is fine in what it covers, but
there is a lot missing. I don't intend to expand this beyond the
programming tasks of Freemarker and Spring Blossom. Parts of this
chapter feel unconvincing to me, as I finished writing some of it long
after I finished the project.
