Over the years I've collected a few pens, mostly fountain pens. Here's my notes and how I personally rate them.

Out of the collection, the ones I've used most are the Lamy AL-Star and Kaweco Perkeo pens. I'm still on the hunt for that ever elusive 5-star writing tool.

## Lamy

I have a few Lamy pens now, and with a converter they are really good. I'm not keen on using cartridges because of the waste and I prefer the ranges of colours offered by bottled ink. With these pens, I especially like the ease nibs can be changed offering a choice range that I can swap in from EF to B. One day I'll get a Lamy Joy to complete the set.

### Lamy Safari
These are excellent pens, but I prefer the Lamy Al Star instead. It's bright red, my least favourite colour for a pen, so it holds red ink only. I changed the nib to a fine and it's very good, but the grip isn't a great shape and restricts how I hold it.

_4/5_

### Lamy Al Star
I really love the metal barrelled Safari pens, if it wasn't for the triangular grip. It's a little restrictive and not optimal or ergonomic for me. These are the same as the regular Lamy Safari but the extra weight makes them feel more balanced.

_4/5_

### Lamy Nexx 

The Nexx is another really good Lamy pen as it uses the same nib types. I'm not a fan of the rubberised grip, but the thicker body works reasonable well. It's an ideal choice if you want a pen on a lanyard.

_3/5_

## Kaweco

### Kaweco Sport

Small pens ahoy! The Kaweco Sport is a tiny plastic pen with a gold plated nib. It only takes certain cartridges, notably Herbin. Some just don't fit and split at the top. It performs well posted, but the small nib is a little scratchy for my taste, and it's too small to use all the time.

Fine nib. This is the second one I've owned so they must be doing something right. It's a little scratchy but very consistent with the line making small writing possible and for a travel pen it's very conservative with ink.

_4/5_

### Kaweco Perkeo 

This fun pen was sold as 'Indian Summer' with a black 'fine' nib, and it's really good. I love the mustard yellow barrel and black cap, and it's very smooth to write with. The triangular grip section works well for me, it's not as extreme as some other pens with similar ideas.

_4/5_

### Kaweco Sport Brass

A heavier version of the sport, this is a favourite already. The heft and build quality is perfect for me, and it feels indestructible. Medium nib is smooth, much better than fine.

_4/5_

## Jinhao

These are good pens, albeit a little heavier in the hand. I like heavy pens sometimes. 

### 1200 'Dragon'

Over the top gold pen with a Dragon for the clip complete with red 'gems' for eyes. It has a nice nib, and is a solid writer. I've paired it with Parker Quink with good results.

_4/5_

## Waterman

I'm on the fence with Waterman. I'm just not sure. I like the designs, and the inks work well so I expect the same from the pens.

### Hemisphere

This pen has never worked well for me, the nib is strange and the converter split. I've a replacement converter but it's waiting it's turn in the rotation to have another go.

_1/5_

### Allure

New pen, not yet tried. It seems well-made, has good balance and a decent nib, and I love the grey camouflage pattern. I had to get a new converter for bottled ink, and it's rubbery so I don't know how well it will do overall. I doubt the longevity of the fittings. 

_?/5_

## ONLINE

This is a new addition to the collection, and they're best described as inexpensive plastic fountain pens.

### Football pen

It's super plastic and covered in footballs. Plastic grip with a failed attempt at sculpting out a grip but it barely makes any difference. Very light, and the cap holds well on the post but isn't really usable otherwise. Nib is a generous M and writes cleanly. I quite like it. For £10 it's a good serviceable pen but I wouldn't cry if I lost it, nor would I replace it.

_2/5_

## TWSBI

These "Te-wib-see" clean demonstrators are something new to me, but add an element of fun to the tools of writing.

### Go

This spring powered fill-and-go pen is fun. I went for the stub nib with this one because I want to use it for calligraphy and decorative writing. 

Filling it is easy; Open it up, press down the spring, put it in the ink, let go of the plunger and it springs back up. Hopefully with the ink inside the pen. For me, it was hard to avoid inky fingers (Diamine bottles). It holds plenty of ink, and while it flows well (not overly wet) it's smooth and easy to use. 

It's worth the £20 as a fun toy, but not as a daily writer. I felt the grip was a waxy plastic that isn't entirely a pleasant tactile experience, but it has uses as a calligraphy pen. Overall I do like it though, and might get one with a medium or fine nib. The ink loading works well and ideally suited to times when I want to switch inks, or just use an ink for a short while like greeting cards.

_3/5_

### 580 ALR
My first piston fill pen. I think it's highly overrated. For me it was too heavy because of the imbalance, resulting in a tiring writing experience. The nib was adequate, and the ink flows well. It gets the job done, but I prefer other pens.  I can't help but rate this lower than I thought I would because I had high expectations from it and have had better pens that cost less and were nicer to write with. It does have  a giant ink capacity compared to converters which can be a boon in certain circumstances, and it is pretty to look at. 

_3/5_

## OHTO

These are good quality budget pens with a certain style that I find appealing.

### Tasche
Tiny pocket pen that doubles its size when the cap is posted. It's very narrow and takes no space at all. It writes really well with a smooth line. OHTO don't mark the nib with size, but it'd say it's a fine nib. It's probably my favourite pocket pen.

_4/5_

### Dude
This excessively shiny silver chrome pen with its unspecified but defiantly medium-to-bold iridium nib is a good pen. It's nice in the hand, and performs well. It's just a bit too medium, and would be even better with a fine nib. In the end I liked this pen but stopped using it before the end of the first ink fill. I found it sometimes randomly was too wet - so much so that it bleeds into the page. I also found myself distracted with a tendency to unscrew itself which I can only attribute to my grip, although this does not happen with any of my other pens. The nib is more like a medium/broad, and too thick for general use.

_2/5_

## Parker

I don't generally like Parker pens, purely because the ink dries up in the pen in less than a week. It doesn't happen to any of my other pens, only to Parkers.

### Parker IM
Nice writing but ink dries up when capped. 

_1/5_

### Parker IM replacement
Parker Customer Services sent me a replacement IM after I enquired on why it dries up so quickly. It's not exactly the same. The grip is black instead of gold, and the caps are not interchangeable. I'll update with more information when I've had the chance to try this because I have too many pens in active use right now.

_?/5_

### Jotter
Nice pen that writes well. A little narrow for my hand. At least it doesn't dry up.

_3/5_

### Vector

I have two of these cheap pens, they are unremarkable and have been out of rotation for a long time. I think there are better pens for the price. but there are also much worse. The tines on the nibs of both are wonky but that might be my doing, and I have reservations over the crack resistance of both the cap and barrel. It does have a nice simple round metal grip which I like, and the balance is good. Probably a good pen to practice adjusting nibs.

_3/5_

## Paperchase
I like Paperchase stationary as a general rule, and have a fondness for their bright and cheerful colours. 

### Transparent pen
This was gifted to me, and is a simple transparent pen with a fun rainbow coloured nib! It's lovely to look at, and write well. Unfortunately ink transfers somehow from the cap to the grip, so it's messy fingers all the way with this one. I need to try it with a different ink, maybe a thicker one to see if it solves the problem.

_3/5_

## Diplomat

I have a Diplomat Traveller pen somewhere, but I can't find it right now. It's probably stashed away with the oddball pens.

### Traveller
A good pen but too narrow, and the cap will not securely post making it too short, hard to use and distracting.
