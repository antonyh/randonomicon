I've moved my social discussion over to Lemmy.

Like the move to Mastodon, there are plenty of non-random reasons for the switch, and plenty of public discussion on the subject. From personal experience I have found that the Lemmy I joined as a community is quite different to commercial communities, in a good way for the most part but still has the same argumentative types that are attracted to the internet. Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.

If I ever decide to play with hosting a Lemmy instance, I'll write it up and document my experiences here.
