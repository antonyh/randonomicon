Riemann

Riemann aggregates events from your servers and applications with a
powerful stream processing language. Send an email for every exception
raised by your code. Track the latency distribution of your web app. See
the top processes on any host, by memory and CPU. Combine statistics
from every Riak node in your cluster and forward to Graphite. Send
alerts when a key process fails to check in. Know how many users signed
up right this second. http://riemann.io
