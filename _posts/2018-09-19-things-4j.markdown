MX4J

<http://mx4j.sourceforge.net>

MX4J is a project to build an Open Source implementation of the Java(TM)
Management Extensions (JMX) and of the JMX Remote API (JSR 160)
specifications, and to build tools relating to JMX.

JMX is an optional package for J2SE that provides a standard way to
manage applications. It can also be used to wrap legacy systems and
provide a standard interface to the outside world, enabling the
development of web services. JMX allows developers to write more modular
and loosely coupled system components and reduce the complexity of
large, interoperating systems.
