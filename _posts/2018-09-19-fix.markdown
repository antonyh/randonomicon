Fixing things
=============

fix problems with Brew (on OS X)
--------------------------------

    brew update && brew upgrade brew-cask && brew cleanup && brew cask cleanup


    When I run 
    brew update && brew upgrade brew-cask && brew cleanup && brew cask cleanup 
    I get:
    Error: brew-cask 0.53.3 already installed
    brew update; brew upgrade brew-cask;  brew cleanup ; brew cask cleanup
