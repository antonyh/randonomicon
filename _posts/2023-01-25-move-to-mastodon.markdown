I little late to add this update here, two months late. 

I've moved my social presence (as quite as it is) over to Mastodon, and can now be located at

https://mastodon.ie/@antony

There's plenty of non-random reasons for the switch, and plenty of public discussion on the subject 
which I don't care to repeat. What I have found, it's Mastodon as a community is far more interesting, 
refreshing, engaging, and has broader horizons and appeal than other social sites. That's good enough for me.

If I ever decide to play with hosting a Mastodon instance, I'll write it up and document my experiences here.
