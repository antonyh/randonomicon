Useful commands for GCP when using the gcloud cli tools

### Cheat Sheet & Help

Start here for a long list of useful commands.

    gcloud cheat-sheet 

Options are described in 'help'

    gcloud help

This will give you the latest and up-to-date information for your version of gcloud cli. You can also search in the help via a command

    gcloud help -- <search term>

this will give a limited set of results and helps find answers quickly.

### Configuration sets

I needed to have multiple logins, and the best way to achieve that objective was via configuration sets.

    gcloud config configurations 
    gcloud config configurations list
    gcloud config configurations create <name>
    gcloud config configurations activate <name>
    gcloud config configurations describe <name>


### Switch projects

Usually GCP will have multiple projects, and you will need to specify which one to use.

    gcloud config set project <my-project-id>

### Get the load balancers for the project with external IP addresses

It's important to know the external interface to GCP, which are enumerated as 'forwarding-rules'.
