You've heard of [Hungarian Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)? Now try the 'logical' progression from this, Reverse Hungarian! Instead of starting the name with the type, end with type.

For simplicity, here's a lightweight list of types. In the true spirit of this naming scheme, feel free to add and adapt these however you see fit.

* i - interface
* o - object class
* n - number
* t - text
* c - currency
* d - date
* m - method/function

e.g.

* Personi
* Managero
* Employeo
* Customero
* Namet
* Agen
* pricec
* dated

Some lovely method names:
* savem
* deletem
* loadem
* initialisem
* getSelectedActionTypem
* randomum

Replace vowels if needed for readability.

* Vehicli
* Bicyclo
* Caro
* Trucko

Add a 'e' or 'u' to further increase pronunciation. Avoid real words.

* counten
* speeden
* xun, yun
* cityet
* descriptionet
* emailen
* timestamped


As you can see this is a great improvement on undecorated naming conventions, and far superior to regular Hungarian Notation in all the ways that really matter. 

Benefits of this new and exciting naming system include:
* having names that are easier to sort and locate by order and yet have type information embedded
* not confusing them with real words
* being able to find type with a simple regex
* they are pronouncable, so you can have real conversation about them
* they aren't actual words so search and replace doesn't affect real text such as labels if you are careful
* they add colour and flair to your code, making it faster to learn and remember what things are
