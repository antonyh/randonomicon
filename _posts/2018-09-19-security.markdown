Deprecated; Docker Tricks and Tips
==================================

Docker security
---------------

####  mount your docker.sock 

You can just mount your docker.sock as a file using the volume options
to provide a container access to the docker API. You can then run docker
commands from within that container. This way a container can even kill
itself. There's no need to run the docker daemon within a container.

#### Docker is Root

Guard your Docker, as the Docker API access gives full root access so
you can access volumes and use the host's network with --net host. Don't
expose docker API to public.

#### USER in Dockerfiles 

By default docker runs everything as root but you can use USER in
Dockerfiles. There's no user namespacing in docker so the container sees
the users on the host but only uids hence you need the add the users in
the container.
