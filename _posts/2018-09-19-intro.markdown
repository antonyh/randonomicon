Shell and terminal
==================

Mastering shell and terminal commands is a challenge, but with some
careful selection of tools, creating some useful aliases, and making

that most of the tools follow of 'do one thing and do it well' it means
that you can master one (often simple) tool, and combine it with others
to get the results that you need.
