Notes
=====

This notebook of development notes is very rough, and is not ready to be
published in any shape or form.

This 'book' is Â©2015 Antony Hutchison, and should not be distributed.

Disclaimers
-----------

Should you be one of the unlucky folk who has somehow obtained a copy,
don't expect anything in here to work, make sense, or even be readable.
By 'rough' I mean exactly that, it's really more of a place for me to
brain-dump. Stop reading now, for your own sake.

If you do have a copy of this text, then with any luck I'll have removed
the chapters that will harm you. No promises though, you're on your own
(in a very legal sense) if you take action on anything written here. You
have been warned. Officially, you have no licence for the content of
this book (in a very legal sense).
