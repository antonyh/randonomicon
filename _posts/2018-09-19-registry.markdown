Docker Registry
===============

There are three basic options for storing the layers required to produce
the containers.

1.  Docker Hub, the 'official' repository

2.  Self-hosted docker repository

3.  Third-party hosted repository services

Official Docker Registry
------------------------

Self-hosted Repository
----------------------

#### Run in Docker and backed with Amazon S3 storage

The easiest way to run a self-hosted Docker Repository is using Docker,
unsurprisingly. This command will start a server, using Amazon S3 for
storage.

\-

docker run -e SETTINGS\_FLAVOR=s3  

-e AWS\_BUCKET=acme-docker  

-e STORAGE\_PATH=/registry  

-e AWS\_KEY=AKIAHSHB43HS3J92MXZ  

-e AWS\_SECRET=xdDowwlK7TJajV1Y7EoOZrmuPEJlHYcNP2k4j49T  

-e SEARCH\_BACKEND=sqlalchemy -p 5000:5000 registry

#### Artifactory

According to the feature list, it is possible to use Artifactory as a
Docker repository. Normally this product would be used for artefacts
produced by Java Maven and other similar tools, but if you are already
using this then it would be wise to investigate further.
