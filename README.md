# Randonomicon

A blog. A book. A steaming pile. It is what it is, which greatly depends on your interpretation.

## Changes to Randonomicon

1. all changes must pass `jekyll doctor`.
2. all changes must include a visual change of some sort, no matter how small.
3. only one new post per change.


## Jekyll
This site uses Jekyll. If you know how to use this, then you can ignore the rest of this README.md file. 

## Installation
With `rbenv`...

```
rbenv install 2.6.5 # or whatever useful version
bundle exec jekyll doctor
```

There's some shenanigans going on with Osx 10.11 and Ruby 2.6 that causes faults sometimes. I don't think this is a 
fault in this project or in Jekyll, but an underlying incompatibility with an obsolescent OS version.
