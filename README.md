# Randonomicon

A blog. A book. A steaming pile. It is what it is which greatly depends on your interpretation of the material.

## Changes to Randonomicon

1. all changes must pass `jekyll doctor`.
2. all changes must include a visual change of some sort, no matter how small.
3. only one new post per change.
4. changing style without adding a post is ok, but adding a post is better


## Jekyll
This site uses Jekyll. 
If you know how to use this,
then you can ignore the rest of this README.md file. 

## Installation
With `rbenv`...

```
rbenv install 2.7.4 # or whatever useful version
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll doctor
```

There are some shenanigans going on with OSX 10.11 and Ruby 2.6 that causes faults sometimes. 
I don't think this is a fault in this project or in Jekyll, 
but an underlying incompatibility with an obsolescent OS version.
